An Streamlit-based chatbot app that integrates with Azure OpenAI Foundry and AI Search for RAG-powered conversations. 
Users can upload chosen documents to allow the chatbot to search these documents and answer questions about them. 
All parameters are fully customisable.

Ensure all parameters are added to `.env` (according to `.env.sample`), and relevant Python packages are installed from `requirements.txt`

Start Streamlit with:
```
streamlit run ./Welcome.py
```
